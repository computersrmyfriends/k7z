%description
Use K7Z if you want to:
* Backup a folder to a storage location
* Create or extract a password-protected archive
* Update an existing archive quickly

Ark (2.6.3) is very handy but it doesn't seem to:
* Create archives with passwords
* Extract (some) archives with passwords
* Update existing archives by default

K7Z is a simple application that attempts to fill these voids.  It probably won't become a total archiving solution.
