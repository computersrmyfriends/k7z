		Required:
			Python (2.4): http://www.python.org/

				P7Zip includes both "7z" and "7za" binaries.
				"7z" operates on a wider range of archive types.  K7Z therefore uses "7z" instead of "7za".
				Fedora Core users must install both "p7zip" and "p7zip-plugins" from the Fedora Extras repository.
