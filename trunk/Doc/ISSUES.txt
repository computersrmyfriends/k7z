K7Z ISSUES

	All:

		K7Z
			Warning: Extracted files will automatically overwrite those that already exist in the output directory.

		P7Zip
			Bug: 4.42: Doesn't display the percentage indicator, so K7Z's percentage indicator won't work properly until the author of P7Zip has fixed this bug.
			Limit: 4.43: Displays the percentage indicator when creating archives, but not to stdout.  The P7Zip author says he will have a think about how this can be overcome.

	Linux:

		Qt
			Bug: 4.2.1: In the 'Qt4 Configuration' program, setting 'Interface --> GUI Effects --> Menu Effect' to 'Animate' can cause an error.  To prevent this, try setting 'Menu Effect' to 'Fade' instead.
				Fix: Please use only Qt >= 4.2.2 with K7Z.

	Windows:

		K7Z
			Limit: The total installation space required for all prerequisites is over 300 MiB.
