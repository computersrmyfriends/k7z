K7Z README



Reason

	KDE - and its associated applications - is the best piece of software that I've ever used.  The fact that it doesn't cost any money is nothing short of ridiculous.

	After using KDE for a couple of years, I've been feeling guilty about not contributing my programming skills (or lack thereof) to the open-source community.  K7Z is my first step towards silencing this feeling of guilt.


Purpose

	Use K7Z if you want to:
	* Backup a folder to a storage location
	* Create or extract a password-protected archive
	* Update an existing archive quickly

	Ark (2.6.3) is handy but it doesn't seem to:
	* Create archives with passwords
	* Extract (some) archives with passwords
	* Update existing archives by default

	K7Z is a simple application that attempts to fill these voids.  It probably won't become a total archiving solution.

	For installation instructions, see INSTALL.txt.  If you encounter any problems, see ISSUES.txt and send me an email if necessary.
