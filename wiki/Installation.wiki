== Dependencies ==


=== Linux ===

==== Required ====

[http://www.python.org/ Python], [http://www.trolltech.com/products/qt Qt4], [http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/intro PyQt4], [http://www.gnu.org/software/tar/ Tar], [http://www.gnu.org/software/make/ Make], [http://p7zip.sourceforge.net/ P7Zip]

  * P7Zip includes both "7z" and "7za" binaries.
  * "7z" operates on a wider range of archive types.  Q7Z therefore uses "7z" instead of "7za".
  * Fedora Core users must install both "p7zip" and "p7zip-plugins" from the Fedora Extras repository.

== Installation ==


=== Linux ===

Ensure that you've installed the applications listed in the above 'Dependencies' section first.

==== Packages ====

  * I provide RPM, DEB and AUR packages alongside the BZip2 source archive of each release.
  * If your Linux distribution doesn't use one of these formats, you'll need to download the BZip2 source archive and install manually.
  * If Q7Z doesn't work after installing the package, use the below procedures to rebuild the installed source files manually.

==== Echo ====

'''
cd Build
make echo
'''

==== Clean ====

'''
cd Build
make clean
'''

==== Build ====

'''
cd Build
make
'''

==== Install ====

  * Please thoroughly check the 'Makefile' for scripting errors before proceeding because I'm not a Linux expert.  It was written by hand and is not guaranteed to protect your data.
  * Proceed with the following commands only if you are certain that this 'Makefile' will not damage your data in any way.  Use it at your own risk.

For all users:

'''
cd Build
make install
'''

For the current user only:

'''
cd Build
make install-user
'''

Add '$HOME/bin/' to the PATH variable in your "~/.bash_profile" or equivalent and restart KDE.

==== Proxy ====

Q7Z will use the proxy server defined by your 'http_proxy' environment variable.  For example, add the following to your "~/.bash_profile" or equivalent and restart KDE:

'''
export http_proxy=http://[user:password@]proxy.isp.com[:80]/
'''


==== Cron ====

In your three-hourly cron directory, create an executable shell script like the following:

'''
#!/bin/zsh

# Local
if [ -w "/media/Exchange/Backup/Q7Z/" ]; then
	/usr/bin/Q7Z.pyw cilL Personal
	/usr/bin/Q7Z.pyw cilL Programming
fi

# Storage
if [ -w "/media/Storage/Backup/Q7Z/" ]; then
	/usr/bin/Q7Z.pyw cisL Personal
	/usr/bin/Q7Z.pyw cisL Programming
fi
'''

If it will be executed by 'root', create symbolic links to your 'Profiles' and 'Lists' dirs in equivalent dirs below "/root/".

==== Xfce (Thunar) ====

Go to the "$(HOME)/.config/Thunar/" directory.  Replace your existing "uca.xml" with "uca.xml.q7z", or merge the two files together somehow.


=== Windows ===

==== Install ====

For all users (use with caution):
  * Launch the #7Z setup executable file
  * Download and install any unmet dependencies
  * Choose locations for the #7Z files and shortcuts

  * Please thoroughly check the 'Makefile' for scripting errors before proceeding because I'm not a Linux expert.  It was written by hand and is not guaranteed to protect your data.
