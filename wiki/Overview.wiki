== Reasons ==


=== Linux ===

After using KDE for a couple of years, I felt guilty about not contributing my programming skills (or lack thereof) to the open-source community.  Q7Z was my first step towards silencing this feeling.  I loved Python and thought Qt4 applications looked great, so PyQt4 was the obvious choice.


=== Windows ===

At the time, I was still working as a software engineer in Windows most days.  Without much fuss, I ported Q7Z across to Windows.  It unfortunately required bulky libraries, so I decided to port the Python code across to C# .NET for increased nativity.  The resultant application was #7Z.



== Purposes ==

#7Z is a 7-Zip GUI for Windows; Q7Z is a P7Zip GUI for Linux. #7Z and Q7Z attempt to simplify data compression and backup.

7-Zip is a file archiver for Windows with a high compression ratio; P7Zip is a port of 7-Zip from Windows to Linux.

Use Q7Z or #7Z if you want to:
  * Update existing archives quickly
  * Backup multiple folders to a storage location
  * Create or extract protected archives
  * Lessen effort by using archiving profiles and lists

Ark (2.6.3) is handy but it doesn't seem to:
  * Create archives with passwords
  * Extract (some) archives with passwords
  * Update existing archives by default

#7Z and Q7Z are simple applications that attempt to fill these voids.  They probably won't become total archiving solutions.
