= Introduction =

  * The J7Z GUI can be customised via downloadable Java "Look and Feel" skins.
  * Plenty of these are available for free from various websites, some of which are listed below.

= Installation =

  * Simply download each desired skin's ".jar" (Java Archive) file to J7Z's 'Lib' folder.
  * If preferred, save it elsewhere and add that folder's full path to J7Z's "Lib-Dirs" file via the 'External' menu.
  * After restarting J7Z, the new skin and any styles (themes) it provides will be listed in the 'Settings' dialog.

= Recommendations =

  * The following skins seem to work quite well with J7Z.
  * Let me know if you find other good ones and I'll add them to the list.
